# G Hack - TheLastMinuteCoders

We chose to work on the third subject, Sustainable energy, in the hope of producing a web service (and who knows, maybe one day an app) where people can search for products and see what types of energy was used in its making.

## Possible improvements
Although we did manage to implement quite a few of our ideas, there are some that we didn'g have the time or the skills to introduce in our work.

- Use image searches through Machine Learning (Vision on Google Cloud) to show relevant results for a search even if the specific product isn't in our database.
- Use tags to simply restrict the results.
- Use a "search engine" like algorithm to restrict results without having the exact item in our database, for example the levenshtein algorithm.
- If an image search engine was implemented, allow users to add images themselves to broaden the image database for each item.
- Implement a user login system and allow verified companies to upload product data by themselves. This would make for a decentrilized and independent solution with very little work for the people managing the tool data.
